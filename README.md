IPL Match Insights – Power BI Dashboard

The project leverages Power BI to visualize and explore insights from IPL match data. Using the matches.csv dataset, I created an interactive dashboard that tells a compelling story through data.

Key Insights:
  -A handful of cities have emerged as major IPL hubs, hosting a higher number of matches.
  -Securing the toss win doesn't necessarily lead to a match victory.
  -A select group of players consistently shine as standout performers.
  -Over the years, teams have increasingly favored fielding first after winning the toss.
  -Some franchises have maintained a strong track record of consistent success across multiple seasons
